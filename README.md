# Smoothio

A custom easing panel for After Effects.

The graph editor gives you two handles per keyframe and nothing else. Smoothio replaces that with a curve editor you can add points to, save as a preset, and apply to any selection — the same easing, reused across a project instead of redrawn by hand.

## Features

- **Curve editor** — drag a bezier curve with as many midpoints as you need. `+` and `−` add and remove points, **Invert Graph** flips the curve, and `0` resets it to linear.
- **Import Ease** reads the easing off the selected keyframes and loads it into the editor, so an ease you like becomes a preset instead of something you rebuild.
- **Presets** — save a curve, and it appears as a thumbnail you click to apply. Presets are stored as files on disk, and can be exported and imported to move between machines or share with others; import offers merge or overwrite on a name clash.
- **Separate Dimensions** applies the curve per axis rather than to the property as a whole.
- **Pop-out editor** opens the curve in its own window when the docked panel is too cramped, and a separate **Settings** window covers preset size, save location, and panel layout (auto, vertical or horizontal).

## Setup

**Install.** Download a release, run the bundled installer, and restart After Effects. The panel appears under **Window ▸ Extensions ▸ Smoothio**. Unsigned panels need CEP `PlayerDebugMode` enabled.

**Develop.** The panel is React and TypeScript built with webpack. Clone the repository, then:

| Command | |
| --- | --- |
| `npm install` | install dependencies |
| `npm run build` | production build |
| `npm run dev` | development build, rebuilt on change |

For After Effects 2023 and later.
